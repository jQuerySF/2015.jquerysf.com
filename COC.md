##Code of Conduct

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any event presented by Famo.us are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

#The Quick Version

jQuery SF, presented by Famo.us, is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

#The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If an event participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by a clearly marked “STAFF” shirt.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events.

###Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

You can also send an email to [info@jQuerySF.com][contact]

###Enforcement

If a participant is asked to stop harassing or inappropriate behavior, they are expected to do so immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate; this may inculde warning the participant, immediate expulsion from the conference with no refund, and/or banning from any future jQuerySF conferences or associated events.

Our foremost concern is the safety and comfort of all our particpants. We will evaluate any possible sanctions with regard to whether or not they provide the safety needed.
